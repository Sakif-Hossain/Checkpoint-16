Despite your thorough investigation, the person sitting at the bar is unfazed. They never looked up, never even casting their gaze your way. //

That’s where we came in.

Mira and I. We started the agency, built it from the ground up with just our heads on our shoulders and a (I say bargained, Mira prefers to say “stolen”) key to the cheapest permanent office we could find.

It’s been three weeks since Mira took off for the Cypher Diamond case. Largest natural sapphire/diamond found at the bottom of Europa VII’s ocean, stolen under the all-seeing eye of the Barge’s best law enforcement and military squads. She usually sprints home the second she’s done, I can’t imagine what’s keeping her.

That’s bad.

(Really, extremely, kind of bad.)

I looked into the logs. The only thing of note was a non-automated message from Checkpoint 16.

Checkpoint 16 is one of many rest-stops strewn across the galaxies where all sorts of people can find respite. 

Though, this one is definitely out of my comfort zone. An illustrious, opulent seven-star hotel that Mira would probably dream of for our future fifty-year anniversary vacation.

I already tried contacting every organization I could- no dice, since neither I nor the agency are “of great repute” (or rather, we’re totally unknown) to all Checkpoint-neutral associations. 

I’ll probably be in the red for the foreseeable future. I’ve got a two-way economy ticket and a one day, one night reservation at Checkpoint 16. 

I’ll have to do what I do best: uncover the truth using everything at my disposal

"Technology allowed us to reach beyond the stars. You can too”. A phrase repeated on every street, every colony and every planet. With interstellar travel a reality, humanity has explored, conquered and, quote-unquote, developed hundreds of cosmic civilizations.

Nevertheless, here are some jobs that robots and AI can’t replace, can’t replicate with enough humanity as people. For one, galactic peace hasn’t been easy- crime in the form of immorality and brutality exists in every corner of every galaxy and every empire.

*You look around at the beautiful, mirrored hallway leading to rooms on each side. 

As you hover your palm over the door, the lock faintly glows as the door opens automatically. This room is leagues nicer than the motels and hostels you’ve stayed at with Mira before. 

In the corner is a closet with some sort of fancy, abstract painting. Leaned up against it is a large mirror that goes up to your shoulders. On the opposite end is a little desk with a consumable synthesizer and a single bed. The bathroom is right at the door- inside it is darker and smaller, but certainly not dirty. The room seems to be well-kept and thoroughly cleaned often.*
